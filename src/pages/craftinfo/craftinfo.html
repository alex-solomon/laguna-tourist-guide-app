              The embroiderer would have to slightly dampen the textile and separate thread by thread, and then stitch them together to achieve the dainty netted look of calado embroidery. Truly mad props to embroidery artisans of Lumban for this feat.Though with my tendencies toward tradition and natural, earthy colors, I couldn’t deny the beauty of the classic colors of piña and jusi.

    <ion-card-content>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Luisiana, an agricultural town in Laguna, is about 108 kilometers away from Manila and about 24 kilometers away from the provincial capital of Santa Cruz. Pandan grows abundantly in Luisiana; the products made from pandan have become the town's signature products. In celebration of the pandan crop and its products, Luisiana holds the Pandan Festival annually during the month of April. Pandan handicrafts can be purchased in Luisiana at the One Town One Product (OTOP) Showroom at the town center. But if Luisiana is far from your location, pandan products can also be purchased during the ANILAG Festival in Santa Cruz, Laguna (however, this festival is only held annually during the month of March). Craftswomen collect the pandan leaves from plants in the wild. Only the young leaves are cut so the plant will naturally regenerate. The young leaves are sliced in fine strips and sorted for further processing. Weavers produce basic pandan mats of standard size or roll the leaves into pandan ropes for other designs. This is followed by a coloring process, in which pandan mats are placed in drums with water-based colors. After drying, the colored mats are shaped into final products such as place mats or jewelry boxes. Final color touch-ups are applied to assure a product of high quality.

         In Marikina city resort owners prize bamboo furniture for giving their establishments a natural touch and pleasantly rustic look. This attribute of bamboo furniture also makes it a highly viable and sellable product in export fairs and trade fairs.According to Elvin-Dimasu-ay, technical education specialist and in charge of the bamboo section of the Department of Trade and Industry’s Cottage of Industry Technology Center (CITC-DTI), you can go into the making of Japanese bamboo armchairs with an investment of P20,000 to P40,000 for tools and equipment and another P1,900 for materials. For startups, though, it is best to first test the waters by just buying alternative tools and equipment. This can bring the startup costs down to about P21,000. You also have the option of just renting all the equipment you need form the CITC-DTI office in Marikina City.
